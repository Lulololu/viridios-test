<!-- PRINCIPAL FEATURES -->

#### Principal Features

    1. Tech stack : Next.js / TypeScript / Semantic HTML / CSS
Use of React Table Library to display the Countries Data Table

    2. React
The components of the application have been designed to be reusable. Moreover, I extracted the SVG icons from the Noun Library and converted it into a modular component.

    3. Next.js
Use of Next.js features : router, Image component, etc.

    5. Fully responsive app
You can use the app on smartphone as well as on computer. The Table is also responsive.

    6. Full A11Y
That's some important point to me: the application I've managed to achieve is entirely accessible.

    7. Design
I've chosen a Colors Schemed supposed to project Viridios' work and value.

    8. Design System
I tried to build a Design System through my code. This is what React and Emotion.js allow us to do.
I used an Emotion theme, within which I integrated reusable properties (colors, dimensions, etc.) throughout the application. This way, the maintainability and scalability of the application gets a lot easier.
The colors referenced in the Emotion theme refer to CSS variables. This allows to benefit from the performance of pure CSS, but also from TypeScript autocompletion (with the Theme object).

    9. Browser Support
The application has been designed to support most browsers. Some modern CSS properties have not been used because they are not sufficiently supported (eg. Flex gap).
